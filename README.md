# School District Re-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Our intial work was done with all the data provided including every school, grade, and student. It was then brought to Maria's attention that the data for Thomas High School's ninth graders reading and math grades appeared to be altered. For this reason we refactroed the previous used coding in Jupyter Notebook, 1st removing the 9th grade data at Thomas High school, making a few changes, and re-running the code.
